Software engineering was never something I ever thought I would be interested in. Growing up I always knew I was going to be a doctor! I always wanted to help people and I always knew I had a soft spot for children. As I got older though, I felt like nurses did more of the work and didn't recieve the respect and acknowledgement they deserved so I transitioned from wanting to be a Pediatrician into wanting to be a Neonatal Nurse or Nurse Practitioner. I grew up blessed though! I grew up with toys and the ability to use my imagination(lol), but I also had access to technology! Having access to the internet opened up another can of warms  for me at a younger age. My coding journey really began before I even knew I would like coding and I think thats so awesome because we have the ability to be whatever we want to be in life. Sometimes you plan to be one thing and end up being another, and thats okay! I remember when  myspace, and Tumblr came out. I was so excited to create my own pages.  I didn't even know then that I was coding! All of the signs were always there. When I went to college, it was for nursing, but I didn't finish with a nursing degree. I literally changed my major my third year of college. It just wasn't my passion anymore. I majored in human relations and minored in women studies. Turns out I still love working with and helping people especially children. I am learning that I'd rather run my own show, so I'm more of a business woman and leader. And then here comes coding years later, like it was a sign trying to get my attention or something. Coding literally popped up too many times for me to ignore, so when I saw that career karma was a free coding app, I just tried it! Ever since then I feel like I've made a choice that felt like it was right! It chose me before I knew I would be  ready to go through with it, and now that I'm going through with it, it's surreal but it definetly feels good!
